We are using a three layer architecture for the app

We don't use reducers for all server calls, only for the data that needs to be shared across all pages 
like the session and user data.

Is important to import pages and components dinamically in order to keep a good performance

images must be in webp format when possible, or jpg. and their size must be specified always
